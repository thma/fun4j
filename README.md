# fun4j
functional programming for the JVM

Welcome to the 2.0 release of fun4j!

fun4j brings functional programming to the JVM. 
It's a framework that integrates major concepts from functional programming into the Java Platform. 
It also provides seamless integration of Java with Lisp coding, by using a just in-time lisp-to-bytecode compiler.
